Hi there, I'm a PhD student at the University of Sydney, within the Complex Systems Group!
A lot of my research is currently centred around time-series analysis, inference, and machine learning, although my interests extend across disciplines. For example, I've applied concepts from quantum-body physics to tackle data-driven time-series analysis problems such as classifcation, imputation and synthetic data generation.


I work primarily in the vastly superior scientific computing language [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia), although I don't mind a bit of Python and MATLAB.
